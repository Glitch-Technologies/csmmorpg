### Crazy Stairs Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game
This is a licensed spin-off of the famous Crazy Stairs RPG game series by LevTheLion.
It includes characters from the original title, and makes permissive use of the game from its respective copyright holder. Much like the original game, it is released with available source code, although CSMMORPG includes the Apache License instead of no license. Attribution is always appreciated. 

Bugs and issues found within the game should be filed on into the GitHub project. They may or may not be tracked independent of the GitHub issue internally on Jira, but developers are expected to keep issue tracking publicly UTD. Regular users are free to contribute to our project, but are asked to refrain from working on developer-defined issues or issues that are already in progress internally without asking permission first. New content is always ok.

Copyright disclaimer: While this game features thematic content from the original work, Crazy Stairs, it is a parody of the original and will make all effort to not infringe on original copyright holder's rights. Issues or takedown requests can be sent in to support@glitchtech.top.
